The main purpose of this project was to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together, and despite having very little experience with these languages prior to starting this project, I was determined to figure things out by myself and not use a tutorial.

I learnt a lot durring this project, and as a result the code is not exactly something I'm proud of - learning on the go produced very spaghetti code!

The game itself is a simple concept - fly the spaceship through the blue ring, and as you do more rings appear (the yellow ring is the next ring to fly through and the red one is the one after that). 

All in all I'm very happy with how the game functions and looks!
