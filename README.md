JUL 2024

The main purpose of this project was to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together, and despite having very little experience with these languages prior to starting this project, I was determined to figure things out by myself and not use a tutorial.

I learnt a lot durring this project, and as a result the code is not exactly something I'm proud of - learning on the go produced very spaguetti code but writing clean, readable code wasn't the purpose of this project.

The game is simple, fly the spaceship through the blue ring, and as you do more rings appear. All in all I'm very happy with how the game functions and looks and look forward to my next web development project!
